<h1> CTR Editor </h1>
<h1> This is a CTR Scratch Level Editor. You can play the levels you've edited. I prefer to play the version from the turbowarp link beacose it has the
  explaination how to add your things and more! Warning! This has nothing to do with Aidrum's CTR Level editor. </h1>

<h1> How to use this? To use this you need to know the X and Y position of your mouse. A turbowarp addon helps to do it, then use the vert X and Y bar to match the exact position you want then count how many ropes there are and for ex. if there are 2 ropes you need to set the variable to 3. Now theres the rope length you can experiment a bit with this and more. The last is to press the add rope button, and the other ones are to hide the bars. Also this is temporary beacose its just a showcase. Full features are in the turbowarp link. Also you can edit it and upload somewhere but i prefer to credit me. You can use my github name or scratch name. </h1>
